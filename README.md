Template for writing python scripts
------------

Many a time I found myself writing some repetitive code to setup a python script. This encapsulates
that repetitive code in a file. So if you want to write a batch python script, just pull this repo into a directory
where you want the script to be, and start editing/adding code.

How to use it:
-------------

1. Download script.py
2. Rename as necessary.
3. Add arguments in ```parse_cmd_line_args```.
4. Add functionality in ```run_task```. Args can be accessed using the ```args``` variable.
5. You should be good to go. Remember to test it :)
